 * This file takes a geometry given by { positionsQuantized, indices }, and returns
 * equivalent { positionsQuantized, indices } arrays but which only contain unique
 * positionsQuantized.
 *
 * The time is O(N logN) with the number of positionsQuantized due to a pre-sorting
 * step, but is much more GC-friendly and actually faster than the classic O(N)
 * approach based in keeping a hash-based LUT to identify unique positionsQuantized.
